    <p>Egg drop soup is an easy to make and comforting soup. It has few ingredients, and can be made in 15 minutes or less.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 C chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. sesame oil</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric <em>(optional for color)</em></li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. cornstarch <em>(mixed with 1/3 C water)</em></li>
        <li>3 eggs <em>(lightly beaten)</em></li>
        <li>1 scallion <em>(chopped)</em></li>
        <li>1/4 tsp MSG <em>(or to taste)</em></li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring stock to a simmer in medium pot. 
            Stir in sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, and MSG.
            Add in turmeric, if using.
            Taste the soup, and add seasoning if needed.
        </li>

        <li>Add the cornstarch slurry to the soup slowly, stirring continuously.
            You can add more or less cornstarch if you'd like a thicker or thinner consistency.
        </li>

        <li>Add the egg while stirring the soup. The speed at which you stir will determine the size of
            the egg swirls in your soup. Stir slower for bigger swirls.
        </li>

        <li>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with scallions. Serve!
        </li>

    </ol>
